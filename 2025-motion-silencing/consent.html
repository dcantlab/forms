          <h2 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Study Title:</span> The Role of Stimulus Features in the Motion Silencing Illusion</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Principal Investigator:</span> Oakyoon Cha, Department of Psychology</h2>
          <h2 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Investigator:</span> Hyerim Kim, Department of Psychology</h2>
          <p>The motion silencing illusion refers to the inability to detect color changes in small dots when they rotate around a fixation point.
            The purpose of this study is to investigate changes in which visual features can be detected during the motion silencing illusion.</p>
          <p>This study is conducted by researchers located in Republic of Korea.</p>
          <p>Before agreeing to participate in this research study, please read the following carefully to understand the procedures, potential risks, and benefits of the study.
            Your participation is voluntary and you may discontinue participation at any time without penalty by closing the web browser.
            If you completed a study and it's currently awaiting review, you can return the study by clicking the looped arrow in the Submissions page.
            After the review, you will no longer able to withdraw your participation.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Background and Purpose.</span> Please refer to <a href="https://dcantlab.github.io/forms/2025-motion-silencing/debrief.html" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Participant.</span> At least 30 participants (up to 300 participants) over the age of 18 will be recruited.
            An initial sample of 30 participants will be recruited.
            Bayesian hypothesis testing will be conducted, and if the results exceed the predetermined stopping criterion, data collection will be completed.
            Otherwise, additional participants will be recruited in increments of approximately 10 until the criterion is met.
            The total number of participants will not exceed 300.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedures.</span> You will first be asked to provide information about yourself (sex, age), and then asked to complete one of the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Viewing two groups of visual stimuli and adjusting one group to make it perceptually as similar to the other as possible,</li>
            <li>Viewing two groups of visual stimuli and reporting which group shows changes in visual features (color, brightness, size, shape, etc.) or more pronounced changes in these features,</li>
            <li>Viewing a group of visual stimuli and reporting whether the group shows changes in visual features (color, brightness, size, shape, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration.</span> This study consists of one experiment that requires 30-100 min.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Risks.</span> Participation involves no more than minimal risk.
            You may experience temporary fatigue or dizziness during the experiment, but these symptoms have no lasting effects.

          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compensation.</span> Upon satisfactory completion of the study, you will receive the amount listed either in the HIT directory (Amazon Mechanical Turk, MTurk) or in the study directory (Prolific), via the payment system provided by Amazon or Prolific, respectively.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefits.</span> Indirect benefits to participation are contribution to knowledge.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidentiality.</span> The only identifying information gathered is either Worker ID (MTurk) or Prolific ID (Prolific).
            Both types of ID are an arbitrary string of alphanumeric characters that is not linked to any personal information.
            The ethics review documents and research data will be retained for three years after the completion of the study. Participants may contact the researcher to access the study results, if they wish.</p>
